	    <p>Welcome to the Random Site of Unknown People. You have now randomly chanced upon Ananya Beevanapalli, who was born on June 4, 2002 in Santa Clara. She has spent her first twelve years living in Sunnyvale before moving to Milpitas. Due to the pandemic, she moved to the University of San Fransisco dorms as a Sophomore in 2021. She has participated in art, dance, martial arts, swimming, and volunteering for many years. She has also spent most of her school years doing homework and struggling to maintain a social life. Despite all that, she has managed to keep quite a bit of a digital footprint since she was two years old. Even then, at least half of what we could scavenge has been made for educational purposes. Her only social media account is pretty inactive and she seems to have a guilty pleasure for children's movies and shows. Recently, she seems to successfully waste a lot of time on the ever recent and popular Youtube shorts. So, if you really want to see what Ananya has done to build her digital footprint, come on and enter browse through site of Ananyaâ€™s digital time capsule. You just might find something interesting.</p>
