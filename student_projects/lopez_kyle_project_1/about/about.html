	<p> 
	Kyle Lopez, who goes by kylehighpez on all social media platforms, can be characterized as a young man who posts less and less with time, but who’s parent’s proudly share his accomplishments and milestones through tagging him in his posts. This peculiar being sets his profile picture and highlight cover photos on his page to be poorly drawn stick figures, and he tends to type in all lowercase. Kylehighpez who claims he is a grocery store business devotes his instagram posts to footage of him dancing and pictures of his girlfriend. He has been dancing for quite some time, as he had been posting dance videos since 2015. Although the majority of his older posts are not present on his profile, we, the internet, will never forget these posts.
