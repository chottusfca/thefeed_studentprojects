        There really isn't much to discover when looking into Dakota Song. In fact all traces of him through personal social media accounts have disappeared since the beginning of COVID (March 2020).While it is difficult to compile a complete picture of him, from what we can look into we can conclude that this person at least seems to have some sort of interest in fashion or art. Through depop and ebay history, we can confirm that Dakota is a buyer/curator of vintage clothing, and aims specifically for unique tees, 70s clothing, 40s-60s sweats, and older levis. On the other hand, his venmo and paypal transactions also indicate that he is a reseller of clothing as well, mostly operating on weekends in locations around LA County, although he has been seen throughout the valley and the bay as well. Dakota’s google history indicates he likes to be an informed seller, showing many random strings of research pertaining to various topics like art, political, music, and cultural history. This is likely due to the nature of his work, dealing with older pieces of clothing, and being able to date them and tell how they came about or why they are special.

        More casual things about Dakota can be found through his youtube recommendations and spotify. Through youtube we learn that Dakota spends much of his freetime watching Vice documentaries about world affairs and drugs, as well as cooking documentaries about new upcoming chefs or already established professionals. Although the two are very far apart, their watchtimes are almost equal so he must enjoy both just as much as the other. He also watches a lot of UFC highlights/ recordings, often after the fight happens Saturday night. He must not like buying the pay-per-views. His Spotify mostly consists of hip-hop but sometimes users can see him playing jazz, alternative, and piano. Dakota’s taste in music seems to be very specific, considering he has a little over 80 playlists and still adds appropriate songs to playlists he created back in 2018.
