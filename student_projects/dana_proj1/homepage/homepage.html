        <h3>"thank you, I know" <br></h3>
        <p>Wow! The boldness of it all!
            Who does she think she is?!</p>
        <p>
            She is a bold, ball of absolute kinetic Energy. Her location is unknown,<br> because she is always moving around the world. As well as the time she is in an area.<br> Her stories say one thing, her facebooks says another, while her twitter and instagram<br> posts go back and forth. One day she has pink hair, the next she has black hair,<br> the next is brown. Who knows what she looks like at any given time.</p>
        <p>Her existence is not linear. Her presense is unknown.<br> Her location is unfound.<br> Try again later.</p>

        <p>This cool girl never smiles, unless her leg is up in the air.
            She spents too much time color coordinating her social media. Who is trying to impress? Herself? Her peers? Her parents?
        </p>

        <p> As the colors pass, you can see that so do her emotions and energies. She harvests the different energies based on her surrounding colors and emenates it to the fullest extent. </p>
        <p>Red? Seductive<br>
            Orange? A dark shadow of a woman<br>
            Yellow. Silly energy. Big goof.<br>
            Green? Water, grass, nature<br>
            Blue. Frowns. Water. Summer<br>
            Purple &amp; Pink is her trasition phase.<br>
            She went pink! her hair! went pink!!!!<br>
        </p>
        <p>Is she aware of her presence online? Carefully coordinated, she watches who sees what. She protect her posts w two alternative personas. Her "main" is filled with adventure. Thrill. Mean girl energy. The other is vulnerability. fear. sadness. Chaos.</p>

        <p> makes you wonder... what is she like... what does she do?</p>
