                Through this website we hope to gain more insight into the life and customs
                of Luis Sanchez. A Peruvian male of 19 years, he keeps to himself both
                in person and online, but he spends - a possibly unhealthy - amount of time
                scouring the vast virtual world known as the internet.
                <br><br>
                Growing up a relatively introverted and reserved child led him to take up
                more isolated and personal hobbies so as to keep himself occupied. For instance,
                he very much enjoys playing and even watching videogames, it is something that
                can maintain his interest for a long time and help keep him active mentally,
                but unfortunately not physically.
                <br><br>
                Surprisingly, he has quite the affinity for art and has spent 16 of his 19 years
                trying his damndest to get better at the craft. He really wishes he had more time
                to draw, but alas, university and general lack of creativity have left his instagram
                account barren and his mind frustrated with its inability to express itself. How sad.
                He really does love art however, it has even manifested into a form of obsession with
                any kind of artistic medium - mainly anime and manga. He has been quite influenced by
                these aforementioned art forms, and he hopes he can instill this same kind of influence
                and inspiration unto others when he is more capable.
                <br><br>
                Since he has never cared much for social practice or interaction, he has a
                minimal social media presence, but he very much enjoys using these outlets in
                his spare time - which he sure has a lot of. As a result, one will
                usually catch him scrolling through memes on Instagram - which have deteriorated his sense of
                humor to comical levels - or reading random tidbits of news and useless facts on
                Reddit.
                <br><br>
                If you are so lucky to catch him outside of these two timesinks, fret not, he is still very
                much distracted and wasting his time. You will certainly catch him watching or listening to
                countless hours of music, videos and streams through the holy procrastination trinity that is
                Spotify, Youtube, and Twitch.
                <br><br>
                I am sure this eloquent summary we have drafted for Luis has painted him to be a very diligent
                and approachable person, yes?
                <br>

                Upon analysis and instruction by our research subject, it seems we may have focused a bit too much on
                some...less favorable traits, and he wishes to end it on a more personal note. We can assure you Luis
                definitely does not just procrastinate all day. Absolutely not. He really enjoys what he does in university
                and is very interested by the prospects that Computer Science and Design can open together. Furthermore,
                he has become quite a bit less introverted with age - thankfully - and he's glad he gets to experience new
                and exciting things with new people. To close, we hope you enjoy delving into the wonderously...simple life
                of Luis, he takes a lot of pride in keeping it as such.
