	<h3>Who?</h3>

	<p>We found Mo Ismail. A bay area native who has spent a large majority of his life up and down the bay. He attended school in San 		Jose, Gilroy, Santa Cruz, and ended up in San Francisco. You can say he’s familiar with the area. 
		Mo has a range of interests and activities. When searching him up, it’s difficult to find results on him. Other than the social platform links, we did find a short news article from Santa Cruz that mentions him a few times. Along with that, we found that he spends his time on the internet primarily on different platforms such as, spotify, instagram, and netflix. Some more information we found, Mo is really interested in sports, music, design work and photography. He is not the most active person on social media or any social platform for that matter, but he does spend time scrolling through. 
		<br>
		Based off of our research you can find Mo fairly easily. If he is not in a library glued to his laptop or his phone you'll find him out on a soccer field, or strolling around taking photos.
