        <p>MAJ is an 18 year-old, BORN 11 2 2000, making them a SCORPIO. They use THEY/THEM or VE/VER pronouns, are an INFJ, and live in San Francisco, CA.</p>
        <p>They primarily use the dying blogging platform of TUMBLR to communicate their thoughts, primarily about fictitious media, across the globe.</p>
        <p>THEY HAVE FOUR BLOGS, each devoted to different interests. They have used outward appearances for these accounts to create aesthetic difference between the four, and perhaps four different identities as an effect of this.</p>

    <h2><span style="color: white">MEDIA USAGE REPORT:</span></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Their first and main blog, which is semi-active and now resides at the URL <span style="color:darkgreen">&#91;REDACTED&#93;</span>, where they used to post about the YouTube gaming group called the Yogscast popular for their Minecraft content. Now, they post about Minecraft, The Elder Scrolls franchise, and leftism, of all things.</li>
        <li>Their second and also semi-active blog, <span style="color:darkgreen">&#91;REDACTED&#93;</span>, an “aesthetic blog” also devoted to the Yogscast and used to gather “aesthetic” photos which relate to the characters. These photos range from glittery outfits to scenic landscape photos.</li>
        <li>Their third blog, this of which is active, <span style="color:darkgreen">&#91;REDACTED&#93;</span>, used for fan content of the Witcher book series by Andrzej Sapkowski and continued as a franchise in gaming by CD Project Red, also referred to as “CDPR” and “the inferiors who ruined the narrative and themes of the series” by MAJ THEMSELVES. They post about the heavy themes of found family and self-acceptance that permeate the series, and reblog a lot of photos of bats.</li>
        <li>Their fourth and newest blog, which is active for now, <span style="color:darkgreen">&#91;REDACTED&#93;</span>, is a fan blog for the cult classic Nickelodeon show Invader Zim, which they never watched when they were in the target age group for, but Enter the Florpus recently produced by Netflix was a, quote, "damn good movie."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Their instagram is barren in relativity to their peers’ accounts, and due to the immense pressure that comes with the upkeep of a concrete social identity, there is an apparent lack of selfies on their account.</p>
    <p>Their main streaming services of entertainment are YOUTUBE and <span style="color:grey">&#91;REDACTED for ISSUES of COPYRIGHT&#93;</span>. They hardly ever involve themselves in the comments section directly, but do browse the comments, against their better judgement. They mostly watch Elder Scrolls analysis and theories, the occasional Yogscast video of nostalgia or new venture, and constantly stream 80’s Japanese albums for background music.</p>
