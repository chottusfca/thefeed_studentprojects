    <h2>About Katrina</h2>
    <p>Katrina Monje is an undergraduate college student at the University of San Francisco. Although she currently lives in Los Angeles, California, she is originally from Manila, Philippines. Her aesthetic consists of neutral tones of nature, grainy films, and the color lilac.</p>

    <p>Katrina likes to watch videos related to absolutely anything she finds interesting and satisfying—cooking, singing, organizing, dancing, photo and video editing, and many more. She even likes to make videos herself. In her small YouTube channel, she likes to share her experiences through storytelling. She especially finds films to be interesting because it can be as honest to a person's narrative as they please; that's what she strives for the most.</p>

    <p>She also likes to perform, especially with people. That’s because she enjoys music a lot. She finds singing and dancing very therapeutic. She listens to a wide range of music genres. She never gets tired of music scores and “lofi” beats, but her favorites are R&amp;B and old school music from the 70’s, 80’s and 90’s. She loves sharing her music with friends. One of her love languages is curating playlists for friends, as well as receiving playlists created by her friends dedicated to her.
        <p />

        <p>Most of all, Katrina is very inspired to document her life and everything that is going on around her. She does so in the VSCO app. Every few weeks,she makes it a point to take photos of people she’s with, food she eats, things she has been working on, places she’s been to, and even things given to her. It's become her haven—a place to show who she is, including her passion in the subtle art of cooking, photography, drawing, and life itself. She thinks that going back to memories through a series of photographs, both intentional and candid, brings happiness and gratitude in her life and provides a greater sense of awareness and belonging. She also hopes it would inspire everyone else to do the same—both those whom she cares about the most and those she hasn’t met yet. She hopes that in the future, these photographs can not only bring back time that is lost, but also transcend emotions that she's felt in the past.</p>
