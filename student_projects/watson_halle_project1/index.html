    <p>According to data research, the human Halle-99 was originated in the entertainment capital of the world, Las Vegas, Nevada. It is estimated that she started her human life on January 20th, 1999. She seemed to have lived her whole life in Las Vegas and after graduating from high school, her location changed to Port Angeles, Washington. Her location was at a junior college called Peninsula College, where she played soccer. During her time there she posted often with her new friends and seemed to be very happy there. But her time there was short, after 2 years she relocated to San Francisco to continue playing soccer at the university. The data supports that she is very interested in graphic and motion design, shown that her major is design. Another aspect we see about Halle-99's life is that she lives a healthy and active lifestyle. We have gathered that assumption by learning that she plays soccer in college and she has been playing for her whole life. Also, she goes on many hikes, walks and workout classes; like boxing, cycling, and barre, with friends. Her fitness and overall health is important for this human being. </p>

    <p>But sadly, we must mention that Human Halle-99's pancreas abruptly malfunctioned causing her to have type one diabetes. The malfunction occurred December of 2017. But according to Halle-99's online patient portal, she seems to have her diabetes under control and is happy with her live with diabetes. Halle-99 has been programmed to wear a foreign device on her arm which had been spotted in some pictures she has posted. The device is a Dexcom G6 which tracks her blood sugar levels and reports them to her cellular device.</p>

    <p>Human Halle-99 seems to spend most of her screen time on Youtube, Instagram, and Pinterest. Most of the content she comsumes is about cooking and food. Looking at the cooking and food content she looks at, we can assume she is vegan. She even has a Instagram account solely dedicated to vegan food and all the vegan recipes she cooks. Looking at Halle-99 most watched videos on YouTube, she is interested on how to cook and what vegan YouTubers eat in a day, so she can get inspiration for her own meal ideas. In addition to vegan food, Halle-99 really enjoys Trader Joe's based on the people she follows and the ads generated from her social media accounts.</p>
