<p>  When googling Savannah Archinal, not much comes up. All we can identified is a piece of her art was featured within an exhbition at University of San Francisco titled “Quarantine Connections" the only other piece of information we can identify is that she made a YouTube video in 2012 to the song “You Don’t know Your Beautiful” by one direction. We now understand why she’s been in hiding ever since. She uses the name: Sav Archinal, or savxyz online more frequently. From this information we can conclude, she is 21 years of age, lives in San Francisco with her black munchkin cat and attends University of San Francisco, we can also infer she religiously uses Spotify and will make fun of you if you prefer apple music, she has a Pinterest account that has never been used. The only other online profiles she retains are instagram and snapchat. Snapchat generally goes on used, however she checks it frequently to view her “Year ago todays” due to her crippling desire for nostalgia. You can also see this through her instagram page which consists of film photos, astrological memes, and stupid videos of her friends acting like children. She appears both mysterious and equally over shared.</p>
