        When not on Instagram, kylehighpez watches Youtube videos of Mixed Martial Arts, Hip Hop dance battles, and design or editing tutorials. Not only does he watch the fights and dance battles, he goes further to watch different content creators who dive deeper and analyze the videos. He compiles strategies that are used in MMA fights, and tries to understand these dancer’s choices in all of their rounds. His Facebook page has little to no original posts, and mostly consists of his parents’ posts of him with his beloved family and Chow-chow dog named Bruce, and reposts of his dancing. We see that his parents are reminiscent of his earlier years of when he practiced Taekwondo. Maybe this is the reason that kylehighpez is interested in MMA. When not on Instagram or Youtube, he loses track of time on TikTok. He does not like any posts, but every time he gets on he is sure to find random posts that interest him such as cooking videos, or things to buy on Amazon. Mostly active at night from the hours of 10 p.m. to 1 a.m., we believe that he has a life outside of social media, but only so little is shared about day to day life.
