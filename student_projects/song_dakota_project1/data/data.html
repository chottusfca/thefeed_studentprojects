    <p>Information on his activity was more difficult to find, through venmos section where you can see transactions between friends and acquaintances, we were able to learn a little about his business. And we can directly view his order history and recent activity on eBay throug his personal profile. He is seen here on Ebay buying a 90s military tee and a 50s sweatshirt, and looks to be selling vintage as well through his venmo transactions.</p>
