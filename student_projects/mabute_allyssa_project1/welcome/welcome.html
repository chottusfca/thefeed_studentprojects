    <h2>Aren't you a curious one?</h2>
    <h4>You’d like to know about the owner of this Map, eh?<br> Hmmm...perhaps we can spare a few details.</h4>
        <p>Here is a Leo, born on the year of the Tiger. Tests have proven her to be a balancing act between INFP and ENFJ, and the Sorting Hat has deemed her — her most prized quality — a Slytherin.</p>

        <p>Like any Slytherin, this map's owner is ambitious. Anyone who has ever had the pleasure (or displeasure, but that's for you to yet decide) of meeting her knows that she needs one of those little time turners with all her running around — she just keeps her academics too busy for her own good.</p>

        <p>She holds high positions in many school organizations, leaving her booked and busy 7 days of the week, 24 hours — who needs sleep? she asks. However, with the new technology in the muggle world nowadays...she's gained the capability of being in many places — with many personalities — as she desires. <i>We may call this magic...if you'd like.</i> <a href="../mainmenu/mainmenu.html"><img src="../img/nav/footsteps_4x4.gif" alt="footprints, next page button" align="right"></a></p>

        <p>The owner is as present on the magical webs as one can be — this map can show you four accounts on the tweeting bird alone, two on the instant photo collector, one to pin photos, another for the movie tube, and a few  for her music...yet there are still so much more to dig up. It feels we've barely scratched the surface, hm? Such a curious girl, so active on all of them...like she wants to speak with everyone and be anyone she wants to be behind these glowing screens.</p>

        <p>Sorting hat, are we sure she is no Ravenclaw with all this thirst for answers and learning? Not a Hufflepuff for her need to connect with people and care for them? Perhaps a Gryffindor? for all the adventures she seeks?</p>
        <br>

    <h3><i>The sorting hat is never wrong...but you may decide for yourself.</i></h3>
