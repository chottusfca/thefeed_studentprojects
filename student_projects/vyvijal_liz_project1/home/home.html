During her recent move to San Francisco, B has been inactive in a massive decline in her activity on any technology. 
Though many times, we find her to be inactive, without a trace for hours. Most times, she is on her laptop, and only on her phone in the AM hours or PM hours.
During her searches on the web, we can find traces of both Spanish and English due to her bilingual abilities. This not only is in her course work but found within many of her favorite entertainment apps such as Netflix, Spotify, and sometimes Youtube.
Most time spent on her mobile phone is largely spent on entertainment and social media. Entertainment consists of iMessage, Netflix, Youtube, Tiktok. Although Spotify is not high up in the ranks of apps used the most throughout the day.
