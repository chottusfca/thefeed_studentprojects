        TYISHA HILL WAS BORN ON MARCH 1ST 2001 IN VISTA, CALIFORNIA. TYISHA WAS RAISED BY MOTHER: ROSARIO SERFIN, GRANDMOTHER: JULIA SOTO, AND SISTER: ASHLEY HAMPTON. WE RECOVERED SOME DATA SAYING SUBJECT IS IN THE TOP TEN SCHOOL RECORDS FOR DISCUS AT RANCHO BUENA VISTA HIGH SCHOOL. SUBJECT IS CURRENTLY A JUNIOR ATTENDING UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. MAJOR IS DESIGN WITH AN ADVERTISING MINOR. JUST RECENTLY MOVED BACK TO SAN FRANCISCO AFTER A TWO YEAR VIRUS SENTENCED THEM TO LOCKDOWN. IT SEEMS LIKE TYISHA HAS HAD A PRESENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA FROM A YOUNG AGE. MANY PHOTOS WERE FOUND ON FACEBOOK POSTED BY POSSIBLE RELATIVES. TYISHA HAS TWO MAJOR SOCIAL MEDIA APPS THEY HAVE USED THE MOST CONSISTENTLY SINCE 2014. INSTAGRAM AND SPOTIFY HAVE COLLECTED A LOT OF DATA FROM THIS SUBJECT THAT CAN BE SEEN ON THEIR OWN PAGE. MUSIC SEEMS IMPORTANT FOR SUBJECTS DAILY USE IS EXCESSIVE. UNDER ENTERTAINMENT WE FOUND SHOWS THEY WATCH THE MOST LIKE, ADVENTURE TIME, EUPHORIA, GENERATION, ELITE, AND MANY MORE. TIK TOK CONSUMES A LOT OF THEIR TIME TOO AND SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING MANY SUBJECTS HER AGE HAVE IN COMMON. THERE IS A CONSISTENT GROUP OF PEOPLE THEY SURROUND THEMSELVES WITH JUSTIN DANAS, JORGE ESCALONA, BENITA IKEZUE, NANCY ESTRELLA, STEPHANIE VASQUEZ. THESE ARE THE ONES CLOSEST TO TYISHA HILL.
