        <h2>about tanvi.html</h2>
        <p>
            Tanvi.html is a human currently located in the San Francisco Bay Area. Standing a mere 5 feet tall, she enjoys wearing chunky platform shoes in an effort to elevate herself to the same eye level as the rest of humanity. As a fashion enthusiast, she enjoys adorning her helf in pastel fabrics and colorful accessories. In fact, she passes time ordering clothes online as a form of retail therapy. When she isn’t shopping online she’s studying, and (when the stars align) creating art. She has numerous tools, blogs, and applications accumulated for her craft. Her most used applications are twitter, messages, paint programs, spotify, camera/photo editing, and youtube (shown below).

            Tanvi.html also enjoys cooking, and watches many food and recipe videos, but she hardly ever actually does it. She is lazy and likes watching people make these extravagant foods rather than actually doing it. Her body also dislikes many foods. If she eats foods containing gluten, tanvi.html will stop working. Nuts and dairy also cause her to glitch out. Because of this, she sticks to eating a lot of fruits and sweets, a habit that it probably wearing her away. Though she constantly researches and archives good gluten free recipes to make for herself, they never amount to anything. She listens to a lot of citypop, j-pop, and electronica music. Surprisingly, she seems to have a dark side; she indulges in scary movies and serial killer documentaries. Additionally she may be into the gore aesthetic; however, it is very inconspicuous compared to her love of all things pastel.

            A homebody, tanvi.html rotates between being at her apartment and school. On rare occasions she can be seen at various arcades, wasting her money away on rhythm games. She also sometimes ventures to art gallery’s such as the SFMOMA, possibly for introspection. Her room is her sanctuary as it has everything she needs: her laptop, bed, and gaming systems. Being relatively shy and reserved in the real world she stays online for 90% of the day using her online persona as a way to make friends. When she does go out she does not like attention and tends to hide in the virtual world of her phone. She often feels more comfortable in the blanket of anonymity that is the internet than in real life and does not contact those in her real life as much as she should, as she feels she can rely on her internet friends more.
