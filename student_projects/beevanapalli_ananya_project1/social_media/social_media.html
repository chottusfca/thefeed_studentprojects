			<h3>Blogspot</h3>
			<a href="https://ananyasri.blogspot.com/"> <img src="../img/blogspot.JPG" alt="2-year-old Ananya Blogspot Screenshot" class="deck"> </a>
			<p>This blog, made by Ananya's parents, includes a couple of pictures of Ananya when she was two-and-a-half years old. At the bottom, she introduces herself and says a few words about who she is. Of course, her parents wrote that too.</p>
	
			<br>
	
			<h3>Facebook</h3>
			<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ananya.Beevanapalli/"> <img src="../img/facebook.JPG" alt="Ananya's Facebook Home Page" class="deck"> </a>
			<p>This is Ananya's only official social media account, one which she practically never uses. She has not posted anything, and she clearly has Facebook just so she can access Messenger.</p>

			<br>

			<h3>Contact</h3>

			<img src="../img/messengerlogo.JPG" alt="Messenger logo" id="imgspace" class="deck">
			<p>Normal messages on the phone, Whatsapp, and Facebook's Messenger are the only ways anyone can contact her. Out of the times she is in contact with someone, it is usually someone from her family. She especially talks to her grandparents (who live in India) almost everyday. If it isn't family, then she contacts classmates for school work. If it isn't classmates, then she contacts her friends. She seems to struggle a little with catching up with friends since most people her age use Instagram or Discord.</p>

			<h3>Youtube</h3>
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNcAKtsbxVggXzuQxyodZKg"> <img src="../img/youtubechannelpic.JPG" class="deck"> </a>
			<p>This is Ananya's Youtube channel. She is not active as a Youtuber, but you can look at some of her activity below.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Uploaded Video</li>
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO1RyxOTjqE"> <img src="../img/youtube_kda.JPG" alt="Youtube dance screenshot" class="deck"> </a>
				<p>This is the only video Ananya uploaded. It is of her dancing in a dance competition (and winning first place) for her dance school, Kriyaa Dance Academy. She was 14 years old in this video.</p>		

				<li>Playlists</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Anand and Me</li>
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGnps3cxnWtEyaQlAMH00L5uYnWeog40c"> <img src="../img/anandandme_playlist.JPG" alt="Anand and me Youtube Playlist" class="deck"> </a>
					<p>This is a playlist of all the videos of Ananya and her little brother, whom she calls Anand (his real name is Aditya). Hence the name "Anand and me". It includes chilhood videos starting from 2004 and most of Ananya's dance performances and competitions.</p>
					<li>Contemporary Hindi Songs</li>
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGnps3cxnWtH1CIdMPHB7iU85bLqrgq8c"> <img src="../img/contemporaryhindisongs-playlist.JPG" alt="Contemporary Hindi Songs Youtube Playlist" class="deck"> </a>
					<p>This is a playlist of some of Ananya's favorite contemporary Hindi songs. Out of all genres, she loves to listen to contemporary songs the most. Though Hindi isn't her mother-tongue language, and so she cannot understand the language, she likes to listen to Hindi songs anyways. </p>
