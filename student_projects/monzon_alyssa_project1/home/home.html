    <h3 class="sansserif">ALYSSA MONZON WAS BORN AND RAISED ON OAHU, HAWAII. HERE SHE LIVED WITH YOUR PAPA DODI, MAMA EUNICE, AND AUNTY KAYLA FOR 18 YEARS. ALYSSA MET YOUR DAD ERIC IN MIDDLE SCHOOL, BUT THEY DIDNT START DATING UNTIL AFTER THEY GRADUATED. YOUR DAD WAS TOO SHY AND THOUGHT YOUR MOM WAS TOO OUT OF HIS LEAGUE (WHICH SHE STILL IS BTW) TO ASK HER OUT. AFTER HIGH SCHOOL ALYSSA MOVED TO SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA TO ATTEND COLLEGE. IN COLLEGE IS WHERE SHE MET YOUR CRAZY AUNTY KESARAH AND AUNTY ZOE. SAN FRANCISCO REALLY CHANGED YOUR MOM FOR THE BETTER. SAN FRANCISCO HELPED HER: BECOME MORE CONFIDENT, FIND HER CREATIVE SIDE, AND FINALLY TAUGHT HER HOW TO LIVE. UNFORTUNATELY THAT ALL WAS PUT ON HOLD A YEAR AND A HALF LATER WHEN THE COVID PANDEMIC HIT (DONâ€™T ASK ABOUT IT NO ONE WANTS TO REMEMBER).</h3>

    <h3>ANYWAY, AFTER ENTERING HER NAME AT BIRTH INTO A SEARCH ENGINE, TWO PROMINENT THINGS COME UP BESIDE HER BORING LINKEDIN PROFILE. THOSE TWO THINGS ARE HER INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT AND A NEWS ARTICLE SHE WAS FEATURED IN. UPON FURTHER EXAMINATION INSTAGRAM SEEMS TO BE A DIGITAL SCRAPBOOK. YOU MAY INQUIRE FURTHER UPON CLICKING THE LOGOS BELOW WHICH ALSO FEATURE HER NETFLIX DATA, GALLERY PHOTOS, AND TEXT MESSAGES.</h3>
