        <p>The Feed is the first ever coded website done by myself, Kala Yamaguchi. <br>
        It features a fun outgoing theme that mimics the edge and playfullness<br>
    of youth culture. As an artist, I wanted this website to express a lot of myself<br>
away from a professional setting. Growing into a young adult, a website <br>
of this much freedom may be harder to attain. I hope to find some joy hopefully<br>
one day looking back on this work of art. </p>
