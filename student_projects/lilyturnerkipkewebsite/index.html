        Lily Turner-Kipke, year 19, is from Vietnam and was later adopted by her two mothers at the age of 4 months. Together, they moved to sunny Southern California to raise Lily and her sister, Kai, who is also adopted from Vietnam. She grew up in a small suburb called South Pasadena, not far outside of Downtown, Los Angeles. 
        <br>
        <br>
	As a child Lily was surrounded by the entertainment industry, being featured as an extra in television show, Mad Men. In addition, Lily’s family is one of the bases for a family on ABC’s television sitcom, Modern Family. 
        <br>
        <br>
	Lily is not a huge television watcher, but some shows that do manage to interest is American Crime Series, The Assassination of Gianni Versace and the Sopranos. Another interest of Lily’s is skincare. She enjoys prepping her skin at night after a long day and in the morning. Lily is always in search of the best affordable product on the market and over the years she has found some great ones. Although she is an art major, the rather intimidating science behind the various acids in skincare products intrigue her.
        <br>
        <br>
	She has now moved to San Francisco, where she attends the University of San Francisco as a Design major. Lily really enjoys the environment of the city and appreciates how unique the architecture is, which she does not experience in Los Angeles. While living in San Francisco, Lily’s taste has burnt a hole in her wallet, as a result she has found employment at Pressed Juicery and has now been there for around 7 months.
