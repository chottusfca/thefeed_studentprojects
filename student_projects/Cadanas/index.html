    <p>This site is dedicated to investigating the individual that goes by Juni.eee. Having only a few social media accounts and rarely posting on them, Juni.eee swears she tries to be a ghost on the internet. However, our extensive research on her internet activity has proven her failure. She is very much active on the internet. After finding Juni.eee’s illustrations, our team created images based on her interests and activity to create Juni.eee’s digital world.</p>
    
    <p>After looking over her Instagram page, we agreed that as a designer, her feed is a bit underwhelming...aesthetically. However, she seems to have many posts of her family in the present and past. She loves her family and reminiscing about her past. She likes and saves many cute and foolish photos of animals, which they all end up making her smile and warming her heart. Based on the other things she likes and saves, we can identify a couple of her interests. She is interested in beauty topics, such as nails and skincare. In the summer of 2019, she had a sudden interest in nail art. Turning to the internet for inspiration, she wishes she had the skills and patience to produce bold and complex nail art. Juni.eee enjoys learning about skincare, through videos and blogs. She wants to improve and nourish her skin...she is tired of acne and desperately wants clear skin. After investing (splurging) on skincare, she sees improvement. Along with skincare videos, she watches dancing videos. She enjoys dancing. She saves her favorite videos, in hopes of learning them one day.</p>

    <p>The only game she has on her phone is Animal Crossing Pocket Camp. The app belongs to one of her favorite video game franchises. She plays it to kill time and feed her Animal Crossing hunger, while she waits for the new game on the Switch. Juni.eee lives relatively close to school and opts to walk, bus and scoot there. Her daily walking average is 6433 steps. She has a bus app that will show the arrival times. After weeks of having saved several scooters on Amazon, Juni.eee finally invested in her own Razor A Kick Scooter.</p>
