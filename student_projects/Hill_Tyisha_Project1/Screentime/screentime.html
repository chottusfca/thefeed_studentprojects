    GATHERING UP SOME OF THE DATA OF TYISHA HILLS CELL PHONE USE. I FOUND THE MOST USED APPS BEING TIK TOK, MESSAGES, SPOTIFY, HBO MAX, INSTAGRAM, SNAPCHAT, AND PHOTOS. THERE ARE MANY HOURS LOGGED ON TO THE TIK TOK APP WHICH IS COMMON FOR MANY PEOPLE THEIR AGE. 
    <br>
<br>
<br>
    IT APPEARS THEY ARE ON THEIR PHONE FREQUENTLY AVERAGING 18HRS OF SCREENTIME A WEEK. THIS MEANS ON THE DAILY THEY SPEND 4HOURS USING THEIR DEVICE. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
    WITHIN THIS DATA WE FOUND OUT ON AVERAGE HOW MANY TIMES THEY PICK UP THEIR PHONE. 73 TIMES A DAY THEY PICK UP THEIR PHONE. THE FIRST APP THEY USE THE MOST DURING PICK UP IS MESSAGES. MAKING SENSE AS MESSAGES IS ONE OF THEIR TOP USED APPS.
