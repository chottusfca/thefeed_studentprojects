    <p> Georgia is a 20-year-old female currently located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Her Delta flight history indicates that she averages three round-trip flights between MSP and SFO every year. Her ‘home’ address programmed in Google Maps is still set as her USF dorm room - though this often causes navigation issues while driving, she can’t bring herself to change it. Georgia now spends most of her time on her laptop because of the COVID-19 pandemic. She spends an average of 2.75 hours per day on Zoom, video conferencing for her classes and job. She works as a research assistant for USF’s Art History department - more than half of the documents stored on her hard drive pertain to various art-historical projects.
        The last 23 photos in her camera roll feature her kitten, Matisse. Her preoccupation with her cat is also reflected in the recent search history for “BHA-free cat food” and “Halloween cat collars.” Her most active conversations in the Messages app are with her sister, Grace, and her best friend, Michael. Her most used apps are TikTok, Spotify, and Google Chrome. Recent searches include “can cats eat raspberries” and “why can’t women donate plasma.” This website features a deeper dive into Georgia’s digital presence and offers a glimpse into her life.
