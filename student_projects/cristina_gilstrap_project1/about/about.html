        <p>Cris.tina primarily spends their internet time cruising the platforms Reddit, Tumblr, Instagram, Youtube, and Spotify. What little data we have gathered about cris.tina suggests they are interested in art and design, cooking and food, videogames, and music. They do not make many social media posts or comments, but often will view, like, reblog, or upvote posts and comments made by other users. How original. </p>

        <p>Cris.tina appears to spend a lot of time looking at pictures of art they find visually appealing. They save many of these images to their camera roll and even have a digital folder on their computing machine dedicated to this activity. The art they look at is not even their own. It mostly belongs to strangers cris.tina will probably never meet or talk to. Perhaps this activity brings cris.tina happiness? Inspiration? Motives are unclear, but the art is pleasant to view.</p>

        <p>Cris.tina spends a substantial amount of time on the Youtube watching videos about food. Watching these videos helps the cris.tina learn new food alchemy skills, expand their recipe repertoire, and of course makes them hungry. Aside from these cooking videos, the seem to watch a lot of things called… “vine compilations" and "memes." Sometimes cris.tina even goes on the Youtube to watch Adobe photoshop and illustrator tutorials, however they do not appear to enjoy those videos as much seeing as they often skip through parts or increase the playback speed. Maybe if cris.tina spent less time watching cooking foods videos at 2am and more time sleeping, they would not always be so tired. </p>

        <p>Cris.tina spends a lot of time googling things related to nerd games they enjoy. The game content they research the most according to their search history and ad data is Pokemon. This search content includes pokemon game guides, pokemon-themed gifts, pokemon forums, and even pokemon news. Cris.tina also spends time looking at a variety of Animal Crossing content. Lately this obsession is related to Animal Crossing New Horizons. Another nerd subject cris.tina appears to fixate on is the videogame Stardew Valley, where they play as a farmer. Why does a human want to spend their (very limited) free time playing a game which simulates the manual labors of farming? According to our data, videogames are intended to be played for fun and relaxation. Cris.tina does not seem to understand this concept.</p>

        <p>Cris.tina also spends a lot of time reading about food, researching new recipes, and watching cooking videos on the Youtube. They love to cook for others and will occasionally post a picture of a dish they have made on the social media platform Instagram. Cooking is a skill some people say cris.tina is actually quite good at. Oddly, there are recipes cris.tina searches online again and again. Why does cris.tina not simply print out these recipes? Or write them down for later? This would be far more efficient than trying to find a recipe again every time they need it. How weird.</p>
